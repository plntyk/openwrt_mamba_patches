+========================================================================
+		VLAN Setup for Home Gateway Solution
+========================================================================
+
+Vlan Setup Program will show how to setup the QuaterDeck's vlan
+for Home Gateway.
+In the sample program, Port 0 (WAN port) and CPU Port (Port 5) are in
+a VLAN 2, and Port 1 ~ Port 6 (including CPU Port) are in a VLAN 1.
+
+VLAN MAP setting for the given sample program is:
+Port 0 (WAN) = 0x20,
+Port 1 (LAN) = 0x7C,
+Port 2 (LAN) = 0x7A,
+Port 3 (LAN) = 0x76,
+Port 4 (LAN) = 0x6E,
+Port 5 (CPU) = 0x5E, and
+Port 6 (LAN) = 0x3E
+
+Notes:
+	1) Trailer Mode is enabled:
+		When Ethernet Device, which is directly connected to CPU port, sends out a packet
+		to WAN, DPV in Trailer Tag should have WAN port bit set (bit 0 in this case), and
+		to LAN, Trailer Tag should be set to 0.
+		Restriction : Only one group of VLANs can have multiple ports.
+	2) Header Mode is enabled:
+		When Ethernet Device, which is directly connected to CPU port, sends out a packet
+		to WAN, VlanTable in Header Tag should have WAN ports bits set (bit 0 in this case), and
+		to LAN, VlanTable in Header Tag should have LAN ports bits set (bit 1~4 and 6 in this case)
+
+hgVlan.c
+	sampleHGVlanSetup is the main function for the Home Gateway setup.
