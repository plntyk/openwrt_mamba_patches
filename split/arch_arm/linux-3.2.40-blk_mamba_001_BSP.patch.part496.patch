+		RMON Counters
+========================================================================
+
+This sample shows how to read/clear RMON counter in the device.
+Please notes that there are three groups of RMON counters in Marvell SOHO Switchs.
+Each group has different set of counters. Therefore it is necessary to find out
+which group the switch device belongs to.
+
+Group for GT_STATS_COUNTERS : 88E6021, 88E6063, and 88E6083
+Group for GT_STATS_COUNTERS2 : 88E6183
+Group for GT_STATS_COUNTERS3 : 88E6093, 88E6095, 88E6185, and 88E6065
