+========================================================================
+		CPU Header Mode Enable or Disable
+========================================================================
+
+This sample shows how to enable/disable header mode for CPU port.
+For more information about header mode, please refer to 88E6063 Spec.
+section 3.5.10 and section 3.7.5.
+
+Notes:
+When Header mode for the CPU port is enabled, Ethernet Device/Driver
+which is directly connected to the CPU port should understand Header Format.
+If Ethernet Device does not know about Header mode, then user may set
+the device to Promiscuous mode in order to receive packets from switch's CPU
+port. After that, it is Ethernet Device Driver's responsibility to handle
+Header properly.
+
+header.c
+	sampleHeaderEnable can be used to enable or disable CPU port's
+	header mode
