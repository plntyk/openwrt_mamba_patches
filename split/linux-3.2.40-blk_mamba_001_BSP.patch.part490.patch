+		Port Monitor Setup
+========================================================================
+
+88E6063 device supports Port Monitoring, which allows a user to monitor
+all the traffic of a certain port.
+This sample shows how to enable/disable Port Monitoring.
+For more information about Port Monitoring, please refer to 88E6063 Spec.
+
+Note :
+Port monitoring supported by ClipperShip has two modes:
+1. Egress only monitoring (monitor packets comming out of the
+monitored port, and
+2. Egress and Ingress monitoring (monitor packet comming in and out
+from the monitored port)
+
